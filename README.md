# Information Security Project
The objective of this project is to apply the knowledge and skills acquired, to develop a software project utilizing information security principles and techniques and demonstrate the understanding how data security could be achieved.

The purpose of our web application is to target healthcare sectors to ensure sensitive data is not leaked and compromised. The web application is mainly used for data sharing. We will ensure there is confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data stored using Role Based Access Control. Thus the administrator is able to grant various employees different types of permissions to the database based on their job scope. Recently, data breaches have become more common in the health industry. We will create a secure web application for health care providers in Singapore. Thus, further ensuring that the 6 pillars of cybersecurity are maintained.
